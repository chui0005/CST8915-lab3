# Reflection Questions

1) What challenges did you encounter when configuring environment variables in the GitHub Actions workflow?
  - No challenges encoutered configuring environment variables for both App servces. THe UI made it straight forward
2) How does deploying microservices on Azure Web App Service differ from running them locally?
  - Local: it runs directly on my machine. So only accessible from my machine. I have to handle setup, scaling (limited to my computer resources)
  - App Service: is a PaaS, meaning Azure handles more stuff for me and the application is accessible to anyone using the IP address. 
3) Why is it important to use environment variables for configurations in a cloud environment?
  - This helps make the app more scalable. If new VMs or App services need to be spun up, there are less changes to the code required.
